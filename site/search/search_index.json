The scene consists of a 3D Mickey Mouse lightbox and a desk-like structure, with various elements that can be controlled and customized. Key Components and Features: 3D Scene Setup: import * as THREE from 'three'; const scene = new THREE.Scene(); const camera = new THREE.PerspectiveCamera( 75, window.innerWidth / window.innerHeight, 0.1, 10000 ); const renderer = new THREE.WebGLRenderer(); renderer.shadowMap.enabled = true; renderer.shadowMap.type = THREE.PCFSoftShadowMap; // default THREE.PCFShadowMap The project utilizes the Three.js library to create a 3D scene. A camera is set up to view the scene from a specific perspective. A renderer is used to display the 3D scene in a web browser. Soft shadows are enabled for more realistic lighting Customizable Lighting: // LED panel const rectLight = new THREE.RectAreaLight( 0xF6E7D2, settings.brightness, width, height, ); // point light 1 const pt1 = new THREE.PointLight( 0xCBC3E3, 10, 500 ); pt1.position.set( 30, 50, 5 ); pt1.lookAt(12,20,0); // point light 2 const pt2 = new THREE.PointLight( 0xCBC3E3, 10, 1000 ); pt2.position.set( 0, 50, 5 ); pt2.lookAt(12,20,0); // point light 3 const pt3 = new THREE.PointLight(0xCBC3E3, 10, 500); pt3.position.set( 60, 50, 5 ); pt3.lookAt(12,20,0); // point light 4 const pt4 = new THREE.DirectionalLight( 0xCBC3E3, 1 ); pt4.position.set( 25,100,-70 ); pt4.rotation.y -= Math.PI/2; // ambient scene lighting const light = new THREE.AmbientLight( 0xF6E7D2 ); // soft white light light.position.z = -25; light.position.y = 5; light.intensity = 0; // add all lights to scene (obs) obs.add( rectLight, pt1, pt2, pt3, pt4, light ); The scene features customizable lighting using various types of light sources. Users can adjust the brightness of the scene's lighting using a GUI control. Lighting options include ambient light and multiple point lights with adjustable colors. Interactive Controls: import { OrbitControls } from 'three/addons/controls/OrbitControls.js'; import {GUI} from 'dat.gui'; const controls = new OrbitControls( camera, renderer.domElement ); controls.update(); const gui = new GUI(); const scenelights = gui.addFolder('Scene Lighting'); scenelights.add(settings, 'ambient', 0,1); scenelights.add(settings, 'point1'); scenelights.add(settings, 'point2'); scenelights.add(settings, 'point3'); The scene allows users to interact with the 3D objects using an OrbitControls interface. Users can rotate and zoom the camera to explore the scene. A GUI interface is provided to adjust the lighting settings and control the visibility of specific point lights. Material Customization: const lightsettings = gui.addFolder('Brite-Lite Settings'); lightsettings.addColor(settings, 'bulb1'); lightsettings.addColor(settings, 'bulb2'); lightsettings.addColor(settings, 'bulb3'); lightsettings.addColor(settings, 'bulb4'); lightsettings.addColor(settings, 'bulb5'); lightsettings.add(settings, 'brightness', 1, 500); The Mickey Mouse design is made up of different colored bulbs, and the project allows users to customize the colors of these materials using the GUI interface. Each bulb material can be individually adjusted in terms of color. 3D Shape Extrusion: const flmesh = new THREE.Mesh(fl, wallmat); // adjust rotation flmesh.rotation.z += Math.PI/2; flmesh.rotation.x -= Math.PI/2; // set position to centered and hieght just below y=0 flmesh.position.x = 30; flmesh.position.y = -.75; flmesh.position.z = 25; // allow desk to recieve shadows from objects in real time flmesh.receiveShadow = true; scene.add(flmesh); The project utilizes extrusion to create a desk-like structure within the scene. The desk-like structure is customizable in terms of color and material. Textures: // reflection mapping on lightbulbs const hdrEquirect = new RGBELoader().load( \"./src/empty_warehouse_01_2k.hdr\", () => { hdrEquirect.mapping = THREE.EquirectangularReflectionMapping; } ); Textures are applied to specific objects within the scene, enhancing their visual appearance. Realistic reflection on bulbs is achieved by mapping a HDR environment map of a warehouse with bright overhead lighting onto each sphere External Data Integration: fetch('src/Mickey Mouse - Sheet1.csv') .then(response =>response.text()) .then(text => { data = Papa.parse(text).data; for (var i = 0; i < data.length; i++) { mickey.push((int)(data[i])); } mickey = mickey.reverse(); }); Colors were translated manually from reference image, converted to 35 x 32 px array of pixel coordinates, and then converted to CSV file The project loads external data from a CSV file and incorporates it into the Mickey Mouse figure. Plotting Points on the Pegboard for(var i = h/8-2; i>=0; i--){ // for each row for(var j = 0; j<((w/8-1)+(1-i%2)); j++){ // for each column const newmesh = new THREE.Mesh(geometry1, mtls[mickey[ct]]); newmesh.scale.x = 0.6; newmesh.scale.y = 0.6; newmesh.scale.z = 0.6; if(i%2==0){ newmesh.position.x = 1.6*j+1.25; } else{ newmesh.position.x = 1.6*j+1.8; } newmesh.position.y = 1.6*i+1.8; newmesh.position.z = .5; obs.add(newmesh); if(i%2==0){ boardshape.holes.push(new THREE.EllipseCurve( ax+5, ay+8, // ax, aY 2.5, 2.5, // xRadius, yRadius 0, 2 * Math.PI, // aStartAngle, aEndAngle )); } else{ boardshape.holes.push(new THREE.EllipseCurve( ax+8, ay+8, // ax, aY 2.5, 2.5, // xRadius, yRadius 0, 2 * Math.PI, // aStartAngle, aEndAngle )); } ax = ax+8; ct++; } ax = 0; ay+=8; } The board in the reference image contained alternating rows of 35 and 36 holes, offset by one This loop has 2 functions Punch a circular hole into the box geometry of the pegboard, so the LED light can shine through Create a new instance of a lightbulb object of the appropriate color in each hole Performance Monitoring: import Stats from 'three/examples/jsm/libs/stats.module'; const stats = new Stats(); document.body.appendChild(stats.dom); The project incorporates a performance monitoring tool (Stats) to track and display the frame rate and other performance metrics. Responsive Design: renderer.setSize( window.innerWidth, window.innerHeight ); document.body.appendChild( renderer.domElement ); const width = 60; const height = 50; The scene adjusts to the dimensions of the user's browser window. This project offers an interactive and visually appealing 3D scene with Mickey Mouse and allows users to customize the lighting, materials, and more using a user-friendly graphical interface. Users can explore the scene from different angles and observe the visual effects of their customization choices. Animation Loop function animate() { requestAnimationFrame( animate ); rectLight.intensity = settings.brightness; light.intensity = settings.ambient; pt1.visible = settings.point1; pt2.visible= settings.point2; pt3.visible = settings.point3; material1.color.set(settings.bulb5); material2.color.set(settings.bulb1); material3.color.set(settings.bulb2); material4.color.set(settings.bulb3); material5.color.set(settings.bulb4); controls.update(); renderer.render( scene, camera ); stats.update(); } The animation loop is constantly updated to reflect changes in the GUI parameters as well as any window size changes","title":"Interactive Mickey Lite-Brite Display"},{"location":"project1/#interactive-3d-lite-brite-display-with-customizable-lighting","text":"","title":"Interactive 3D Lite-Brite Display with Customizable Lighting"},{"location":"project1/#project-description","text":"This technical project involves creating an interactive 3D scene that recreates a classic children's toy and a customizable lighting setup using the Three.js library.

It offers real-time interaction by capturing mouse movements to control the camera's position and direction. What is Stereoscopic Rendering? Stereoscopic rendering is based on the principle of presenting two slightly different images to each eye, mimicking the way human eyes perceive depth in the real world. It involves: Dual Perspective Rendering: Two separate views of the scene, representing the left-eye and right-eye perspectives, are generated. These views simulate the slight offset observed by each eye in a natural setting. Displaying Views: The left-eye and right-eye images are typically displayed side by side or in quick succession. When viewed through stereoscopic glasses (often polarized or active-shutter glasses), each eye perceives its respective image, resulting in a perception of depth and three-dimensionality. Adjusting Camera Settings: In 3D applications, the camera setup is crucial. The camera settings need to mimic human eye separation to create an accurate stereoscopic effect. Parallax Barrier The parallax barrier effect is a glasses-free 3D technology used in displays, such as autostereoscopic screens (screens that provide 3D without requiring glasses). Key aspects include: Barrier Layer: A barrier layer consisting of a series of precise slits or barriers is placed in front of the display panel. Directional Light Control: The barrier restricts the direction of light emitted by the display, ensuring different pixels or subpixels are visible from different viewing angles. Perspective Variation: Each eye sees a slightly different set of pixels due to the barrier's directional control, creating a stereoscopic effect without requiring glasses. Anaglyph Rendering Anaglyph rendering uses color filtering to create the illusion of depth perception without specialized displays. It involves: Dual-Color Images: Two images of the scene are rendered, each overlaid with a different color filter (typically red-cyan or red-blue). Use of Glasses: Anaglyph glasses (with corresponding color filters) are worn by the viewer. Each lens filters out one of the colored images, ensuring each eye sees only its respective view. Color Separation: When the filtered images are superimposed in the brain, the color differences create a perception of depth and three-dimensionality. Key Components 1. Scene Initialization ( init() Function) // create GUI to switch between fx const gui = new GUI() var stereofx = gui.addFolder('Stereo Camera'); gui.add(settings,'Effects',['Stereo','Anaglyph','Parallax']).onChange(function(value){ switchEffect(value); }); gui.open() var curreffect = settings.Effects; container = document.createElement( 'div' ); document.body.appendChild( container ); camera = new THREE.PerspectiveCamera( 60, window.innerWidth / window.innerHeight, 1, 100000 ); camera.position.z = 3200; scene = new THREE.Scene(); // Environment rendered as Cubemap scene.background = new THREE.CubeTextureLoader() .setPath( 'textures/cubemaps/' ) .load( [ 'px.png', 'nx.png', 'py.png', 'ny.png', 'pz.png', 'nz.png' ] ); GUI Creation: Utilizes dat.GUI to create an interface for selecting rendering effects. Environment Setup: Establishes the 3D environment, including a container for the scene, camera, textures, materials, and sphere meshes. Renderer Configuration: Configures the WebGL renderer and sets its pixel ratio. 2. Effect Switching ( switchEffect(value) Function) function switchEffect(value){ if(value == 'Stereo'){ effect = new StereoEffect( renderer ); effect.setSize( window.innerWidth, window.innerHeight ); } if(value == 'Anaglyph'){ effect = new AnaglyphEffect(renderer); effect.setSize(window.innerWidth, window.innerHeight ); } if(value == 'Parallax'){ effect = new ParallaxBarrierEffect(renderer); effect.setSize(window.innerWidth, window.innerHeight); } } Effect Handling: Dynamically switches the rendering effect based on user selection in the GUI (Stereo, Anaglyph, Parallax). 3. Event Handling function onWindowResize() { windowHalfX = window.innerWidth / 2; windowHalfY = window.innerHeight / 2; camera.aspect = window.innerWidth / window.innerHeight; camera.updateProjectionMatrix(); effect.setSize( window.innerWidth, window.innerHeight ); } Window Resize: Adjusts camera aspect ratio and effect size upon window resize. function onDocumentMouseMove( event ) { mouseX = ( event.clientX - windowHalfX ) * 10; mouseY = ( event.clientY - windowHalfY ) * 10; } Mouse Movement: Tracks mouse movement to control the camera's position and orientation. 4.Animation Loop function animate() { requestAnimationFrame( animate ); render(); } animate() Function: Starts the animation loop using requestAnimationFrame. function render() { const timer = 0.0001 * Date.now(); camera.position.x += ( mouseX - camera.position.x ) * .05; camera.position.y += ( - mouseY - camera.position.y ) * .05; camera.lookAt( scene.position ); for ( let i = 0, il = spheres.length; i < il; i ++ ) { const sphere = spheres[ i ]; sphere.position.x = 5000 * Math.cos( timer + i ); sphere.position.y = 5000 * Math.sin( timer + i * 1.1 ); } effect.render( scene, camera ); } render() Function: Updates the scene elements and camera positions based on mouse movement and time, then renders the selected effect. Breakdown of Operations GUI Setup: Enables users to choose between rendering effects. Scene Creation: Generates a 3D environment with spheres positioned randomly within the scene. Rendering Pipeline: Facilitates rendering through WebGL using different effects. User Interaction: Captures mouse movement to dynamically control the camera's viewpoint. Responsive Design: Ensures the application adapts to window size changes for a consistent user experience. Overall Functionality Interactive Visualization: Presents a 3D scene with the ability to switch between multiple rendering effects. Real-time Interaction: Allows users to manipulate the scene via mouse movement. Adaptive Rendering: Handles dynamic resizing of the viewport for consistent display across various window sizes.","title":"WebGL Stereoscope Effect"},{"location":"project2/#webgl-stereoscope-effect","text":"","title":"WebGL Stereoscope Effect"},{"location":"project2/#overview","text":"The application sets up a 3D scene containing multiple spheres and allows users to switch between different rendering effects: Stereo, Anaglyph, and Parallax.

Introduction The Node Graph Visualizer is a graphical user interface that visually displays relationships between nodes in a Dependency Graph software architecture The Dependency Graph (aka \"Node Graph\") structure is the industry standard for developing graphics applications The corresponding Visualizer is simply a user-friendly and code-free interface that can be used to manipulate nodes in real-time rendering applications .

References and Appendices"},{"location":"project4/","text":"OpenGL Mesh Viewer OpenGL-based Mesh Viewer Implementation Objective The task involves creating an OpenGL-based mesh viewer capable of displaying multiple models simultaneously, each shaded using the Blinn-Phong illumination model. User interaction functionalities, such as mouse-driven model rotation and camera movement, are also implemented. The viewer is expected to load models, apply transformations for scaling and positioning, and render them alongside interactions and appropriate lighting effects. Components and Implementation Model Loading and Display The application loads models provided as command-line arguments and arranges them uniformly within a 2x2x2 cube centered at the origin. A new TriMesh class manages model loading (Load), bounding box calculation (GetBoundingBox), OpenGL buffer handling (DeleteGLBuffers, UpdateGLBuffers), and rendering (DrawGL). Shading and Lighting Implements the Blinn-Phong shading model for each model, computed within the fragment shader, resulting in smoother color transitions and improved specular highlights. Utilizes three point lights with varying positions and colors to illuminate the models, enhancing their visual appearance. User Interaction Model Rotation: Allows users to click and drag the mouse to rotate the models around the origin. The x and y changes in mouse coordinates determine the rotation matrices applied to the models. Camera Movement: Incorporates keyboard input (x and z keys) to adjust the camera's distance from the origin along the z-axis, preventing the camera from moving too close to the models. Reset Functionality: Pressing the spacebar resets both the model rotations and the camera position. Camera Setup Initially positions the camera at (0, 0, 2), looking at the origin along the -z direction, with an up-vector of (0, 1, 0), and a vertical field of view of 60 degrees.

Main Function The main function initializes the OpenGL window, sets up the VAO, creates objects (spheres and meshes), sets materials and lights, and runs the main rendering loop. The result is an interactive 3D rendering application where you can manipulate objects using keyboard inputs and mouse interactions. It supports rendering spheres and meshes with materials and lighting in an OpenGL context. The code structure includes functionality for handling different types of 3D objects, setting up materials, and handling user inputs to interact with the rendered scene. Technical Implementation Notes Shader Implementation Implements new vertex and fragment shaders to facilitate the Blinn-Phong shading model for enhanced visual quality and lighting effects. OpenGL Rendering Utilizes OpenGL functionality to manage and display meshes, leveraging vertex buffer objects for efficient rendering. User Interaction Handling Incorporates GLFW callbacks for mouse button and cursor position events to manage model rotation. Manages keyboard input to adjust the camera's distance from the models and reset functionalities. Result and Recommendations The completed assignment provides a functional OpenGL-based mesh viewer capable of loading, positioning, and shading multiple models using the Blinn-Phong illumination model. It offers interactive features for user-controlled model rotation and camera movement, ensuring a dynamic and immersive viewing experience.

Altered RayTracer::Render() to generate multiple random rays through each pixel for antialiasing, enhancing image quality. Part 2: TriMesh TriMesh Functionality: Implemented TriMesh functionalities ( Hit , RayFaceHit , Save , Load , GetBoundingBox , ComputeFaceNormals , ComputeVertexNormals ) in trimesh.cc . Enhanced scene parser ( raytra_parser.cc ) to load triangle meshes using the w command. Generated and verified rendering for sphere_mesh.scn and suzanne.scn . Mesh Generation: Implemented BuildWatertightSphere() and BuildSphereWithTexCoords() in main.cc of mesh_gen . BuildSphereWithTexCoords() generates a non-watertight sphere mesh with vertex texture coordinates mapped from spherical coordinates. BuildWatertightSphere() creates a watertight sphere mesh without boundary vertices, edges, or faces. Part 3: Texture Mapping FaceGeoUV Class: Implemented FaceGeoUV in face_geouv.h and face_geouv.cc , along with necessary modifications in HitRecord and Surface::Hit() functions for different surface types. Texture Handling: Implemented ImageTexture::Value() in image_texture.cc to evaluate textures at specific locations. Modified PhongMaterial to support diffuse textures, allowing evaluation of textures at hit points. Scene File Parser Update: Updated the scene file parser to support textured Phong materials using image textures. Part 4: Bounding Volume Hierarchy (BVH) BVHNode Implementation: Completed BVHNode::BuildBVH() and BVHNode::Hit() functionalities in bvh_node.cc . Introduced a scene-level BVH in main.cc of rtbasic for efficient rendering. Mesh-level BVH (Bonus): Implemented TriMesh::BuildBVH() to construct a BVH of mesh triangle faces for optimized intersection tests. Created a new BVHTriMeshFace class to represent individual TriMesh faces for BVH construction. Final Renders: Rendered scenes such as jug_triangle_soup.scn , sphere_mesh_textured.scn , jug.scn , and dandelion.scn to demonstrate improved rendering with added functionalities. The assignment includes significant enhancements to ray tracing capabilities, mesh handling, texture mapping, and BVH implementation.
